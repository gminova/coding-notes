## What are first class functions, and higher order functions?
JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens. That’s because in JavaScript or any other functional programming languages functions are objects.

---


### **First class functions** 
These can be treated just like any other object (or data type), which means they can passed or returned as arguments. For example, you can have an array of functions:

---


```javascript
const sum = (x, y) => x + y;
const subtract = (x, y) => x - y;
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;

const operations = [sum, subtract, multiply];
```
In the browser
```javascript
>operations
<(3)[ƒ, ƒ, ƒ]
0: (x, y) => x + y
1: (x, y) => x - y
2: (x, y) => x * y
```

---


### **Higher order functions** 
A Higher-Order function is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output. Kind of like nesting one function in another one. For example:
- map()
- filter()
- reduce()

---


For example:
```javascript
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = arr1.map(item => item * 2);
console.log(arr2);
```

Returns a new array after each integer has been multiplied by two.
```javascript
(3)[2, 4, 6]
0: 2
1: 4
2: 6

```

---

## What is a callback function? Give an example of a callback function and explain what happens when it is executed

- A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing — hence the name ‘call back’. 


---


- Any function that is passed as a function to another function is a call back function.

---

- Callback functions ensure that one function doesn't exceute until a function it is dependant on has executred. 

---


Example:

```javascript=
myCoolFunction() {
 console.log(1);
};
```
```javascript=
anotherCoolerFunction() {
 console.log(2)
}
```
```javascript=

myCoolFunction();
anotherCoolerFunction();
```


---


# 1
# 2

---

```javascript=
function mySlowFunction(){
  setTimeout( =>{
    console.log(1);  }, 500 );
}
```
```javascript=
anotherCoolerFunction() {
 console.log(2)
}
```
```javascript=
mySlowFunction()
anotherCoolerFunction();
```

---


# 2
# 1

---

JS didn't wait for mySlowFunction to do it's thing before moving on myCoolerFunction.

Real world example 
```javascript=
twitter.get('the route of our request i.e. 
search tweets', search parameters i.e. all 
mentions of FAC17, function(err, data, response) 

{
  if(`there isn't an error`){
  `do some cool code we don't understand yet`
  } else {
    console.log(`the error`);
  }
})
```

---


Only when do we have a response from Twitter will our callback be invoked. 

---

## What is the call stack?

* A call stack is a **data structure**  which records the function calls, basically where in the program we are

* If we call a function to execute , we push something on to the stack, and when we return from a function, we pop off the top of the stack.

* that uses the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

---


1. **data structure**  is a collection of 
* data values, 
* the relationships among them, 
* and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data principle;

---


2. **LIFO** Last in, First Out: it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

---



### Why is useful to understand what a call stack is:
An understanding of the call stack will give clarity to how “function hierarchy and execution order” works in the JavaScript engine.

---


### What it is used for?
The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

---

## Asynchronous vs Synchronous programming

---

### Synchronous programming:
- things happen one at a time. 
- When you call a function that performs an action, it returns only when the action has finished. 
- This stops your program from doing other things for the time the action takes.

---


### Asynchronous programming:
- allows multiple things to happen at the same time. 
- When you start an action, your program continues to run. 
- When the action finishes, the program is informed and gets access to the result (for example, the return value).
- other processes are allowed to start, and may even finish before the original task.

---

### Why asynchronous programming:
- synchronous code has the potential to block further execution until it has finished what it’s doing. 
- In English, long-running JavaScript functions can make the UI or server unresponsive until the function has returned. Obviously this can result in a terrible user-experience.

---

**JAVASCRIPT IS SYNCHRONOUS BY NATURE, BUT WE HAVE VARIOUS METHODS TO MAKE IT PERFORM TASKS ASYNCHRONOUSLY**
-these include callbacks, promises, async functions.
